JudoAssistant Meta Service (WIP)
================================
*Work in Progress*: Note, this service is an early work in progress. It's still
very much non-working. This also serves as a project for me to learn go. Expect
things to change as I familiarize myself with the language.

This repository contains the meta service for JudoAssistant Live. The meta
service is the web service responsible for user authentication/registration and
managing meta data of all tournaments.
